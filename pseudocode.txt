notation:
[fn] - function to write
[fn*] - function already exists in outline

things to define:
 - word_list: set a list of words/phrases to choose from.

things to keep track of:
 - letters already guessed
 - number of incorrect guesses / number of guesses remaining before game over
 
code outline:
[fn] main function to start hangman game

	[fn] select one word randomly from word_list (answer)
	
	[fn] create game board
		- game board will be a list of characters. the length of the board equals the length of the answer.
		- initial board will contain _ for each letter in answer
		- if spaces appear in answer, the board will contain a space instead of _  
	
	*** GAME LOOP START ***
	
	[fn] print game board
		- print board to show up as one line, not appearing as the list. 
			ex: the cat shows up as _ _ _   _ _ _
		
	prompt player to guess a letter (guess)
	
	check validity of input, and reprompt player if any of these conditions happen:
		no characters 
		more than one character
		has non-alpha characters
		guess was already made
			
	[fn] if guess is in answer:
		[fn] update board to show where letter appears
		[fn*] print updated board 
		[fn] check if board shows complete answer
			if yes, player wins
			if no, continue playing
		
		- if guess is not in answer:
			+1 to incorrect guess count
			tell player that guess was wrong
			check if player has hit max number of guesses allowed
				if yes, game over, player loses
				if no, continue playing
	
	*** GAME LOOP END ***
		
	if player wins or player hits game over
		ask player if they want to play again, prompt player for yes/no answer
			if yes, play hangman again
			if no, quit

			
MVP
- player has 6 incorrect tries before game over.  # tries remaining shows in text form (no hangman art)
- player sees game board in "_ _ _   _ _ _" format
- game supports both words and phrases, small list of words/phrases will be added for testing


MF for Final
- extend word_list
- add hangman art to game board


Nice to Have
- print how many guesses it took for a player to win for that word
- let players add their own words/phrases to word_list
- ask for player's name, refer to them by name while playing
- change settings option: vary the number of incorrect tries (would have to change/remove hangman art)
